                                Lauren Shiba, the older sister of the protagonist Jayden Shiba, takes over after her brother becomes weak and unable to lead the team

                                Although the series claims to always be growing, the appearance of a female Red Ranger didn’t happen until her first appearance in November 2012

                        It wasn’t permanent either; appears in the second season only, but proves to be a fan favorite over her brother.
