                            For a show that boasts inclusivity, bullying one of the main actors off the show doesn't agree with that claim

                                Partially it is because of an adaptation error, as her Japanese counterpart is a male
                            </li>

                                The first LGBTQ+ character in the mainline series

                                Other characters were revealed as part of the LGBTQ+ community before her; however, they were only a part of lesser known media

                            The question remains: Was she written as LGBTQ+ to include that community, or was it written in order to lower production costs to re-record scenes?
