                        Zack Taylor, the first Black Power Ranger
                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                            <li>
                                Zack Taylor was introduced in the series as the hip, fun, and groovy black cast member. He wasn’t known for practicing karate like his white male friend Jason
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When given his power coin, he was given the Mastodon power coin and took on the role of the first Mighty Morphin Black Ranger
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Although this was huge for inclusion in pop culture media, especially on a TV show. It wouldn’t matter as he was the sole black cast member, given the role of the Black Ranger
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The actor, Walter Emanuel Jones, personally chose to be the comic relief, rather than sticking with the original casting as the smart and witty Blue Ranger
                            </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>
                        Trini Kwan, the first Yellow Power Ranger
                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Vietnamese actress Thuy Trang portrays Trini, but her character was Chinese-Japanese.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            She was known as the calm, collected, and second-smartest member of the team. Again, the inclusion of an Asian-American is a great sign of inclusion, but her casting also sparked controversy as she was the first Mighty Morphin Yellow Ranger. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Never had a skirt on her suit, simply because the Japanese footage had a male actor as the yellow ranger
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Given a "redemption arc" with Zack Taylor in the Power Ranger Comic Books series'
                        </li>

                        Replacing Trini and Zack, Righting Wrongs?

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Once the characters Trini and Zack were written out of the story, they were replaced by Aisha and Adam respectively
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Aisha’s family background goes as far back as her family origin residing in an African village, and Adam’s family being of South Korean descent.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It comes across as a subpar way to right their wrongs.
